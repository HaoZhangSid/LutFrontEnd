# Project Setup

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have `live-server` installed globally. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so with the following command:

```sh
npm install -g live-server
```

## Running the Project

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Start the development server by running:

```sh
live-server
```

This will launch the project in your default web browser.

## Notes

- Ensure your project files are located in the directory where you run `live-server`.
- If you need to specify a different port, you can run:

```sh
live-server --port=8080
```

Replace `8080` with your desired port number.
