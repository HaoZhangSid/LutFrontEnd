# LutFrontEnd

## Overview

**LutFrontEnd** is a multi-page responsive website designed for a photography studio. It includes the following pages:
- **Home** (Main Page)
- **About Us** (Company Introduction)
- **Portfolio** (Photography Showcase)
- **Contact** (Get in Touch)

This project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, providing a modern and clean design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

**Important Note:**  
Opening the HTML files directly in a browser may cause some images not to display properly. This is due to browser security restrictions on local file access. It is recommended to run the project using a local server, such as **live-server**.

# Project Setup

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have `live-server` installed globally. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so with the following command:

```sh
npm install -g live-server
```

## Running the Project

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Start the development server by running:

```sh
live-server
```

This will launch the project in your default web browser.

## Notes

- Ensure your project files are located in the directory where you run `live-server`.
- If you need to specify a different port, you can run:

```sh
live-server --port=8080
```

Replace `8080` with your desired port number.
